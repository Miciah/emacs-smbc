Emacs-SMBC
==========

The fun (and the copyright) credits go to [SMBC](http://smbc-comics.com/) of course!

Emacs-SMBC is a plugin to help you (Save the world? Sadly no) read SMBC without leaving your Emacs!

It is planned to have a lot of functions to make reading SMBC easier.

### TODO

* Check for new comics every time on startup
* Allow reading previous comics as well
* Cache last few comics
* Allow opening comic in browser
* Read some more SMBC :smile:
