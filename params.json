Sadly no) read SMBC without leaving your Emacs!\r\n\r\nIt is planned to have a lot of functions to make reading SMBC easier.\r\n\r\n### Installation:\r\nIf you don't have Melpa configured already, put this in your `.emacs` or `init.el`:\r\n```lisp\r\n(when (>= emacs-major-version 24)\r\n  (require 'package)\r\n  (add-to-list\r\n   'package-archives\r\n   '(\"melpa\" . \"http://melpa.org/packages/\")\r\n   t)\r\n  (package-initialize))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen follow it up with `M-x package-install` and enter `smbc` in the following prompt.\r\n  \r\n### Usage\r\nSimply load the file (place it in your `.emacs.d` and load it, or else use `M-x load-file` and give its path).<br>\r\nBetter still, add it to your `init.el`, it's easy and fast to load.\r\n\r\nAccess the latest comic with `M-x smbc-get-latest`.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\nOn MELPA as `smbc` [here](https://github.com/sakshamsharma/melpa/blob/master/recipes/smbc)\r\n\r\nReddit discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/4lrjln/a_simple_smbc_viewer_for_emacs/)\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n* Check for new comics every time on startup\r\n* Allow reading previous comics as well\r\n* Cache last few comics\r\n* Allow opening comic in browser\r\n* Use RSS feed instead of parsing HTML\r\n* Read some more SMBC :smile:\r\n",
